## Review of the SDLC

### 6-Phase SDLC index

1. Identify problem
2. Plan and monitor project
3. Analyze details
4. Design components
5. Build / Develop solution
6. Deploy / Implement solution

-----

### SDLC variations
Most projects fall on a continuum between Predictive and Adaptive

**Predictive**
- Requirements well understood
- Requirementrs well defined
- Low technical risk
- Easy project management (PM)

**Adaptive**
- Uncertain requirements
- High technical risk
- Hard project management

### Predictive SDLC

An earlier approach based on engineering, tyypically have sequential phases

**Phases**
- Groups of development activities
- Planning, analysis, design, implementation, and deployment

#### Traditional Predictive SDLC - Waterfall model

1. Project Initiation, frozen upon complete
2. Planning, frozen upon complete
3. Analysis, frozen upon complete
4. Design, frozen upon complete
5. Implement, frozen upon complete
6. Deployment, frozen upon complete

### Adaptive SDLC

**Incremental Development**
- Complete portions of the system in small increments
- Incrementally intregrated as project progresses
- A "growing" system

**Walking Skeleton**
- The complete system structure is built first, but with bare-bone functionality
